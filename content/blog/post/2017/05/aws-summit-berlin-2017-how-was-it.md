![AWS Summit Berlin](aws-header.png)

As you may know or not my current company Axel Springer Ideas Engineering has a really flat structure. This means that we need and have rules...

erwähnenswertesten Events, das den Themen Digitalisierung, Cloud Adoption und Next Generation Application gewidmet ist

The whole conference is free. You only need to register online and that's it. There were over 3000 participants and it was really crowded. 

One good question: Who was this conference for? It is not easy to answer, as Amazon tried to create an event for everyone. The Ops guy, with a strong focus on his daily work. The programmer, who is interested in Lambdas, Alexa Skills and Machine Learning. The CTO, who wants to know what is hot. The business guy, who needs to know what to do. The salesman, who wants to decide which solution to buy? 

# TL;DR
- Only one day: 15.05.2017 at [Station Berlin](https://www.station-berlin.de/en/)
- [7 tracks in parallel](https://aws.amazon.com/summits/berlin/sessions/)
- What is was about: 40% business, 30% advertisement, 20% tech stuff, 10% bullshit (also known as advertisment)
- Really short sessions, only about *30 minutes and only 5 minute breaks* between them
- Some dome live coding in 10min which is quite impressive
- Overall a good quality of the talks
- better booths than JAX or BED-CON
- en sind vor Ort vertreten, geben Tipps und berichten von ihrer Erfahrung mit dem Cloud Service

Here are the three things I took from the conference:
- An AWS certification will help your CV and you should get one
- Amazon focuses on Alexa and Lambdas - try both! 
-

# The vendor booths
Zahlreiche Hands-on-Aktivitäten sind für Besucher des AWS Summits den ganzen Tag zugänglich. Bei der „Ask an Architect bar“ können Besucher beispielsweise Experten des AWS Solutions Architect Teams zu AWS-bezogenen Themen befragen. Egal ob es um die Basics oder nutzerindividuelle Anliegen geht: Die AWS-Architects können in persönlichen Einzelgesprächen zielgerichtet helfen. Im Innovation Lab wird die Cloud anhand von User Cases veranschaulicht

# And the talks?
I'll tell you about 3 good and 3 bad talks.

## Serverless GraphQL Applications with Lambda
## 7 Things You Must Know to Build Better Alexa Skills
This was an mid-level talk about building Alexa skills. If you don't know what a Alexa skill is: It is the name of apps for the Amazon Alexa platform. One of the Alexa Devs hold the talk in the keynote hall. It was a lot of fun and quite a good talk - more of an AWS flagship talk. He even showed code examples!

The most important sentence: "It is an user interface." #voiceui

And here are the 7 things:
1. "Design for the ear" with a lot of tips
2. "Use the skill builder"
3. "Be mindful of your training data" with examples of what is good and what not
4. "Leverage States"
5. "Persistence" eg. Session Attributes and Dynamo DB
6. "Voice requires cognitive processing"
7. "Listen to people actually talk"

## The Two Cultures Revisited - One Year in the Life of a DevOps Consultant



## Alexa - VoiceOps on AWS
The presenter called himself a "DevOps Engineer" and he said the employ 5 DevOps - can someone explain to me what this could be?! 


## How Deutsche Börse Transitioned from Subversion to GitHub Enterprise and AWS Within Record Time
I will only give you the abstract: "This talk describes Deutsche Börse's journey from Subversion to GitHub Enterprise on AWS within just a couple of months. The disruptive change did not only involve a huge migration effort from version control and ticketing systems but also a change to a cloud based infrastructure and agile development mindset. Learn about the cultural and technical challenges faced during that journey and how they got solved in record time."
