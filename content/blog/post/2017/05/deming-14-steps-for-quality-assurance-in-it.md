Total Quality Management for programmers

Known as the father of Total Quality Management is William Edwards Deming. He summarized his method in 14 steps. His ideas have proven vital in production in both Japan and later in the US. As a big fan of classic production theories I wanted to apply his ideas to programming. Here are his 14 steps, adapted to the modern world of software.

# 1 Create constancy of purpose for improving products and services.
# 2 Adopt the new philosophy.
# 3 Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality.
# 4 End the practice of awarding business on price alone; instead, minimize total cost by working with a single supplier.
# 5 Improve constantly and forever every process for planning, production and service.
# 6 Institute training on the job.
# 7 Adopt and institute leadership.
# 8 Drive out fear.
# 9 Break down barriers between staff areas.
# 10 Eliminate slogans, exhortations and targets for the workforce.
# 11 Eliminate numerical quotas for the workforce and numerical goals for management.
# 12 Remove barriers that rob people of pride of workmanship, and eliminate the annual rating or merit system.
# 13 Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement for everyone.
# 14 Put everybody in the company to work accomplishing the transformation. 
The transformation of the company is the job of everybody.
