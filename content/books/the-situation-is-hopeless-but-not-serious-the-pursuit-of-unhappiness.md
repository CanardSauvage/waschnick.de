I read this as part of a special issue, containing both this book and another one from Watzlawick: "Anleitung zum Unglücklichsein" and "Vom Schlechten des Guten: oder Hekates Lösungen".

The title is really meant as it is: Watzlawick describes detailed ways for yourself and others to dive into the deepest unhappiness. But what does he want xxx?

Self-fulfilling Prophecies

# Conclussion
The language is really nice. Some people claimed it to be to complicated with long sentences, but I enjoyed the flow of Watzlawicks words. The book is also a really good fit as a present, as it is short and gives a lot of impulses.
