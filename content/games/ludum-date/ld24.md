My second game for the Ludum Dare :) In theory it is about the evolution of kittens, but it's not really finished. Currently it is more about fighting. But: There are 7200000000000 possible different kittens in the game! ;) Thanks for playing! 


Tools used: 
- GraphicsGale + Paint.Net 
- Aviary Music Creator (http://advanced.aviary.com/) for the music 
- Meow-Sounds from http://www.freesound.org/ 
- Eclipse / Java 1.6 
- JLayer for MP3 

The game: 
- Click with your mouse 
- Buy a kitten 
- Fight! 
- Level up. 
- Get another kitten, buy some food and let them mate. 
- Get 5000$ to win. (Sorry, there is no real goal...) 

I will upload the source asap.

After my first game and first LD, Iâ€™m in for the second time. This time it will be the jam, as one of my friends is joining me. He will be doing the graphics and sounds, so I can focus on coding ðŸ˜‰ Nevertheless, this will be his first game, so we will mostly try to stay on the Ballmer Peak for 3 days ðŸ˜‰ Personally, Iâ€™m aiming to create a more polished game, as I was not satisfied with my first game.

Coding: Java with Eclipse (notch-style with no librarys)
Graphics: Paint.Net / GraphicsGale / Tiled
Sound: MilkyTracker or Steinberg Sequel

Good luck and have fun
